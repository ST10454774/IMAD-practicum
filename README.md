## User Interface 

 

User Interface (UI) is the point of interaction between a user and digital device or software application. It encompasses all elements that a user interacts with, such as screens, pages, buttons, menus, icons, and any visual component that allow users to navigate, interact, and engage with the system. 

In this case I am the user and I interact with a digital software, where I'm required to create an application that should manage a userâ€™s screen time in a week. 

 

## Purpose of the application 

 

The app I was required to make is called Screen Time Manager. The application is to allow users to see how much of their time they spend on their screen. It shows them the duration of time they spend on their screen from Monday to Sunday (in one week). This application includes three screens, and in these screens, users will be able to navigate themselves on their time spent on the screen. 

 

## About The Application 

 

## The Splash Screen 



The above image shows the first screen (splash screen) of the application. It shows the logo of the application, the name of the application, my student number, my name and the start and exit app buttons. The start button is meant to be clicked so that the user can access the main screen of the application. The exit app button is meant to be clicked on if the user wants to exit the application. 

 

The image above shows the code for the first screen (splash screen) showing all necessary coding to navigate from the first screen (splash screen) to the second screen (main screen). 

## The Main Screen
